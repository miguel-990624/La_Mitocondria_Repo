# JavaScript Interactive Project - "La Mitocondria"

This project was developed by the work cell **La Mitocondria** as part of the training process at **Riwi**. The main objective was to practice and strengthen the basic concepts of **JavaScript** through **DOM manipulation**, also integrating **HTML** and **CSS** to create an interactive experience with a retro pixel video game theme.

## 🕹️ Description

The created website functions as an interactive environment where users can press buttons with different functionalities, allowing them to experiment and reinforce their JavaScript knowledge.  
Highlighted features include:

- Interactive buttons that trigger various actions in the DOM.
- Click sound effects.
- Background music for atmosphere.
- Visual design inspired by retro pixel-style video games.

## 🧪 Types of Buttons Developed

As part of hands-on learning, we implemented different buttons that activate core JavaScript concepts. Each button contains specific logic and an interactive functionality:

- **🕒 Conditional Greeting Button**  
  Displays a different greeting depending on the time of day: “Good morning”, “Good afternoon” or “Good evening”.  
  > 🔧 Uses conditionals (`if` / `else`) and functions with `Date()`.

- **🔢 Counter Button**  
  Increases a counter each time it's pressed, updating the on-screen value in real time.  
  > 🔧 Uses variables, event listeners, and DOM manipulation with `innerText`.

- **🎲 Random Selector Button**  
  Randomly selects a message from a predefined array and displays it on the screen.  
  > 🔧 Uses arrays, `Math.random()`, and functions.

- **🛑 Input Validator Button**  
  Checks if a text field has content. If it's empty, it displays a warning message.  
  > 🔧 Uses *truthy/falsy* values, conditionals, and basic form validation.

- **🎨 Color Change Button**  
  Changes the background color of an element when clicked, using predefined colors in an array.  
  > 🔧 Uses data structures (arrays), conditionals, and style manipulation with JS.

- **🔁 Loop Button**  
  When pressed, it generates a list of items on the screen such as the days of the week.  
  > 🔧 Uses a `for` loop and dynamic creation of DOM nodes (`createElement`, `appendChild`).

Each of these buttons represents a concrete exercise of fundamental JavaScript concepts, designed to reinforce learning through direct interaction with the webpage.
